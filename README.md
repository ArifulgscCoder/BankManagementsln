Description: An In-Memory CRUD application for Bank Management in C# is a simplified project that simulates managing bank accounts without using a persistent database. It involves creating classes to represent bank entities (e.g., BankAccount, Customer), and implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using data structures like lists or dictionaries.

Key functionalities include:

Adding new customers/accounts: creating and storing customer data in memory.
Retrieving customer/account information: displaying data on request.
Updating records: modifying customer/account details.
Deleting accounts: removing data from the in-memory store.
This project is ideal for learning object-oriented programming, data manipulation, and basic CRUD operations in C#.
